# hello world

    Oh, hello! There you are. I'm glad you are here. You’re ready for your next assignment. Just rest, lie in bed, and you’ll be out of here in no time. However, before I take care of you, the future, and everything in between, I must brush my teeth.
    You see, I’ve lost track of time. Everything is either too slow or too fast. And it’s up to me to decide whether I am slow, or you are too fast. But don’t worry—every little detail is going to be taken care of.
    This is a story that begins on a Wednesday morning—the farthest back in the past that I can go. “Let yourself be guided by angels,” she said, and that’s exactly how I started this way.
	It seems the more I resist, the less I move on, and what I really want, my friend, is for me to go home. But the people inside and the people outside—for very particular reasons—need to be on the same side. It’s not up to ME; it’s about WE.
